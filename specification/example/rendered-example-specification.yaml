# Required Parameters
# -------------------

# [REQUIRED]
# The base directory to use when finding the subdirectories and files below.
# 
# In this example, we assume we are working from the repository it self, the location of this
# file is nested in a subdirectory, so will appropriately target the root direcotry of the
# repository.
# 
# Note. You can provide absolute paths, or different paths, if you have custom configurations.
# Please do note you will need to adjust the subsequent directories to accomodate your changes if
# those directory locations have also been changed such that it breaks the existing template.
# 
base_dir: ../

# [REQUIRED]
# Directory containing default values for generating YAMLs
values_dir:
  path: ../templates/values

# [REQUIRED]
# Directory containing all template files that will be populated from loading
# both the values and scenarios (overrides) files.
template_dir:
  path: ../templates/jinja

# -------------------
# Optional Parameters
# -------------------

# [OPTIONAL] 
# Specific file containing a scenario that will have values that will override the default
# values supplied in the values_dir. 
# 
# If the attribute "scenario_file" is not declared, then the
# default values will be used as the scenario.
scenario_file:
  path: ../scenarios/example-scenario.yaml

# [OPTIONAL] 
# Experiment schema that will generate the cartesian product of all values specified in the below
# section. These values will be used as the final override values in generating the complete set
# of YAML documents to be used during provision and runtime. 
# 
# If the attribute "experiments" is not provided, then it is assumed the user ONLY wants to 
# provision (standup) a stack.
