# Benchmark Comparison Analysis

This document presents a comparative analysis of two LLM deployments:
1. **Baseline**: Standard deployment (typically using vLLM)
2. **LLM-D**: Optimized deployment using LLM-D

## Latency Comparison

![Latency Comparison](latency_comparison.png)

This visualization compares key latency metrics between the two systems:

### Time to First Token (TTFT)
- Measures how quickly each system starts generating its first token
- Lower TTFT means better responsiveness for users

### Generation Time
- Measures how long it takes to generate the complete response once started
- Lower generation time means faster overall completion

### Total Response Time
- Combines TTFT and generation time to show end-to-end latency
- Represents the complete user experience from request to final response

### Token Generation Rate
- Shows tokens generated per second during the generation phase
- Higher values indicate more efficient token production

## Throughput Comparison

This visualization shows throughput metrics:

### Overall Tokens per Second
- Compares the total throughput capacity of each system
- Includes processing for both prompt and generation tokens
- Higher is better, indicating greater system efficiency

### Relative Performance Improvement
- Shows the percentage improvement of LLM-D over the baseline
- Positive percentages indicate LLM-D outperforms the baseline
- Demonstrates the efficiency gains from the optimization

## QPS Performance Comparison

This visualization shows how performance scales with increasing query load:

### Latency vs QPS
- Shows how response time changes as query rate increases
- Steep upward curves indicate degradation under load
- Flatter curves indicate better handling of concurrent requests

### Token Rate vs QPS
- Shows how token generation speed scales with increasing load
- Helps identify maximum effective throughput for each system
- Diverging lines indicate different scaling properties

## Understanding the Results

When comparing the systems, look for:

1. **Latency Improvements**: Lower TTFT and generation times in LLM-D indicate better responsiveness.

2. **Throughput Gains**: Higher tokens-per-second in LLM-D indicates more efficient processing.

3. **Scaling Behavior**: How each system handles increasing load (QPS) - flatter curves indicate better scaling.

4. **Performance Consistency**: Smaller boxplot ranges indicate more consistent performance.

The analysis provides both median and statistical variance measures to help understand not just average performance but also consistency and reliability.
