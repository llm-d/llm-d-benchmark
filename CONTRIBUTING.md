# Contributing to llm-d-benchmark

## Governance Structure

`llm-d-benchmark` adopts the following hierarchical technical governance structure:

- A community of **contributors** who file issues and submit pull requests
- A body of **core maintainers** who own `llm-d-benchmark` overall and drive its development
- A **lead core maintainer** who is the catch-all decision maker when consensus cannot be reached by core maintainers

All contributions are expected to follow `llm-d-benchmark` design principles and best practices, as enforced by core maintainers. While high-quality pull requests are appreciated and encouraged, all maintainers reserve the right to prioritize their own work over code reviews at-will, hence contributors should not expect their work to be reviewed promptly.

Contributors can maximize the chances of their work being accepted by maintainers by meeting a high quality bar before sending a PR to maintainers.

### Core maintainers

The core maintainers lead the development of `llm-d-benchmark` and define the benchmarking infrastructure and strategy for the broader `llm-d project`. Their responsibilities include:

- Proposing, implementing and reviewing load profiles, parameter configurations, run rules, data collections, and analysis of workloads to `llm-d`
- Enforcing code quality standards and adherence to core design principles

The core maintainers should publicly articulate their decision-making, and share the reasoning behind their decisions, vetoes, and dispute resolution.

List of core maintainers can be found in the [OWNERS](OWNERS) file.

### Lead core maintainer

When core maintainers cannot come to a consensus, a publicly declared lead maintainer is expected to settle the debate and make executive decisions.

The Lead Core Maintainer should publicly articulate their decision-making, and give a clear reasoning for their decisions.

The Lead Core Maintainer is also responsible for confirming or removing core maintainers.

### Decision Making

#### Uncontroversial Changes

We are committed to accepting functional bug fixes that meet our quality standards â€“ and include minimized unit tests to avoid future regressions. Performance improvements generally fall under the same category, with the caveat that they may be rejected if the trade-off between usefulness and complexity is deemed unfavorable by core maintainers. Design changes that neither fix known functional nor performance issues are automatically considered controversial.

#### Controversial Changes

More controversial design changes (e.g., breaking changes to workload profiles, load generators, run rules or data collection and analisys tools) are evaluated on a case-by-case basis under the subjective judgment of core maintainers.
