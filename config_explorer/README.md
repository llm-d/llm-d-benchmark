# Configuration Explorer

The configuration explorer is a library that helps find the most cost-effective, optimal configuration for serving models on llm-d based on hardware specification, workload characteristics, and SLO requirements.

This library provides the tooling for LLM serving such as
- Capacity planning:
  - for any LLM on Hugging Face, determine the per-GPU memory requirement for loading the model and serving requests, taking into account parallelism strategies
  - from workload characteristics in terms of max model length and concurrency, determine the KV cache memory requirement
- ðŸš§ Configuration sweep and recommendation
  - given SLO requirements in terms of TTFT, TPOT, and throughput, visualize the optimal `llm-d` configuration, including Inference Scheduler and vLLM, for achieving the SLO
  - For unseen configurations, predict latency and throughput from a inference performance estimator


## Installation

* Requires python 3.11+
* Requires pip3

Currently, the core functionality is in the form of a Python module within `llm-d-benchmark`. In the future, we might consider shipping as a separate package depending on community interest.

1. (optional) Set up a Python virtual environment
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

2. The `config_explorer` package can be installed via `pip`

    If you have cloned the `llm-d-benchmark` repository, run the following at the project root:

    ```bash
    pip install ./config_explorer
    ```

    Otherwise, to use `config_explorer` independently of `llm-d-benchmark`, run the following:

    ```bash
    python -m pip install "config_explorer @ git+https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-benchmark.git/#subdirectory=config_explorer"
    ```

3. Invoke functions in the package via

    ```python
    import config_explorer.capacity_planner as cp
    import config_explorer.explorer as ex
    from config_explorer.plotting import (
        plot_scenario,
        plot_scenario_tradeoff,
        plot_pareto_tradeoff
    )
    ```

## Use

To demonstrate usage of the configuration explorer library, an experimental frontend has been developed. A Jupyter notebook [analysis.ipynb](../analysis/analysis.ipynb) is also available, which can be used for interactive analysis of benchmarking data results.

### Frontend
A Streamlit frontend is provided to showcase the capabilities of the Configuration Explorer rapidly. Since the core functions are in a module, users may feel free to build their own frontend, such as a CLI, by making use of those functions.

Running the Streamlit frontend requires cloning the `llm-d-benchmark` repo. Make sure you have already installed the required dependencies for the `config_explorer` package following the Installation guide [here](#installation).

```
git clone https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-benchmark.git
pip install -r config_explorer/requirements-streamlit.txt
.venv/bin/streamlit run config_explorer/Capacity_Planner.py
```

The Sweep Visualizer page supports visualizing a collection of `llm-d-benchmark` report files. To get started easily, you may download the data from the [public llm-d-benchmark community Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1r2Z2Xp1L0KonUlvQHvEzed8AO9Xj8IPm). Preset options have been selected for each scenario. For example, we recommend viewing

- `qwen-qwen-3-0-6b` using the Chatbot application highlight Inference Scheduling
- `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct` using the Document Summarization application highlight PD Disaggregation

Default values have been populated once those options are selected. Advanced users may further conduct their own configuration.

### Analysis Notebook

See [../analysis/README.md](../analysis/README.md) for notebook usage.

### Library
Users may import the functions like the following to use in their code after `pip install git+https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-benchmark.git`.

```
from config_explorer.capacity_planner import *
```
